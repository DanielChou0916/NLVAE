# VAE for Stress Latents

This repository contains the implementation of a **NonLinear Variational Autoencoder (NLVAE)** for learning latent representations of stress paths in geomechanics.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Training Dataset:** [Mixed Stress Path Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielchouvae/mixed-stress-path/)
- **Validation Dataset:** [Validation Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielchouvae/validation-set/)

These datasets contain stress-strain data generated under various loading conditions and are used to train and validate the VAE model.
